# Airbnb-Analysis
This project utilizes MongoDB Atlas to analyze Airbnb data, encompassing data cleaning and preparation, Streamlit web application development for geospatial visualization, and the creation of interactive visualizations and a comprehensive dashboard. Its primary goals include data cleansing, geospatial analysis, and skill enhancement in MongoDB, Python, and data visualization. The project places a strong emphasis on maintaining code quality, thorough documentation, and the sharing of a demonstration video on LinkedIn for evaluation.

## LIBRARIES NEEDED

### 1. Pandas:
  For data manipulation and cleaning.
### 2. Streamlit:
  For building the web application interface.
### 3. MongoDB:
  For database management and interaction.
### 4. NumPy:
